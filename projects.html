            <h2>Evolutionary Fairness: Navigating the Dynamics of Fairness Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                Currently in the beginning states, this project seeks to investigate the dynamic balance between individual and group fairness in societal systems like education and housing. While merit-based selection processes may seem individually fair, they can perpetuate systemic inequities over time, leading to group unfairness. We aim to develop a framework using simulations and game theory to analyze how fairness evolves within these systems. By identifying conditions that contribute to inequity propagation, we aim to devise interventions to mitigate group unfairness.

            <h2>Discretionary Trees: Understanding Street-Level Bureaucracy via Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>How do street-level bureaucrats use their discretion when assigning critical resources, and does it help or hinder the people they serve? This project explores that question in the context of homelessness services. By applying machine learning to real-world administrative data, we identify the simple rules caseworkers often use to guide their decisions and distinguish situations in which they deviate from those rules. Surprisingly, we find that these “discretionary” choices are not random: caseworkers tend to apply discretion to less vulnerable households and do so in ways that improve overall outcomes. This reveals that human expertise can complement (rather than conflict with) algorithmic approaches, shedding new light on how and when front-line public servants depart from policy to tailor decisions—and how those departures can sometimes achieve better results for vulnerable populations.</p>

            <h2>Learning Stable Matchings in Two-Sided Bandit Markets</h2>
            <p>
                How can two groups of agents, neither of which fully knows its own or the other side’s preferences, still learn to form stable matches over time? This project tackles that problem by extending multi-armed bandit methods to two-sided matching markets. We propose new algorithms that let each side learn its preferences on the fly—without explicit coordination—and still converge to stable matchings. Our theoretical analysis shows why (and under what conditions) these algorithms should work, while experiments highlight how quickly they arrive at stable outcomes under different preference structures. The results open up promising new avenues for online resource allocation and marketplace design where preferences are initially unknown on both sides.

            <h2>Entropy-Driven Online Planning: Elevating the Value of Information in Uncertain Environments</h2>
            <p>This project tackles a critical shortcoming of popular online POMDP planners, like POMCP, which tend to overlook early information-gathering actions in domains where the payoff for such information only arrives many steps later. By integrating an entropy-based heuristic into the UCB1 exploration strategy, my novel algorithm, POMCPe​, better recognizes the long-term importance of clarifying actions even when no immediate reward is apparent. Experiments in the Long Hallway domain—a challenging environment specifically designed to expose this weakness—demonstrate that POMCPee​ significantly outperforms standard POMCP, consistently driving the agent to gather crucial information sooner and thus make more optimal decisions. This work reveals how quantifying and rewarding the value of information can yield more robust and efficient planning in real-world, partially observable scenarios.</p>
